Overall setup of the system:

LocalClient sends move to server
Server queues request, and dequeues head request (atomically)
Sends reply to all clients (maybe assign a localclient or remote client recipient field?)
Client receives request and parses it
If client ID not its own, send to particular remote client
Else do the particular thing
(under this setup server may need to send an ack or nack for the local client's request. 
Else the client may hang waiting for a reply??)

Basically, server message parsing and handling takes place in localclient.Therefore localclient
is the one connected to a port

Server somehow needs to store all the addresses and ports of all the localclients
(let's use a data structure like an arraylist this time?)
